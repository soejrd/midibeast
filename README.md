The current files have a misaligned slider in the sliderboard.

You will need to fix this if I haven't yet. And if you're reading this, I haven't yet. Aside from that this is quite an easy build. You will have to still do a lot yourself though. I will update this later with more information, but I can't remember the sliders I used for example. 

Built mine for around 200 euros. Could expand a lot on this by making some banks, have better midi resolution, more output options blablabla, feel free to do so.
